<!-- <a href="#history"> History</a>  -->
<p id="click-text">In 2007 I got my first taste of Software development at a Denver based startup called max3.com. It was a digital media distribution platform where the users became the content vendors and were paid for it. My primary role was QA but I wore many hats working for this company and fell in love with the process. Over the course of the next few years I worked a variety of different jobs honing my technical skills in different areas. The most interesting of these jobs was probably my teaching/ technologist role with Rhythm Vision. I was responsible for recording audio and video with kids in classrooms at various schools around the front range. The primary objective of the program was to create social interactions through the activity of music and then investigate how we work together as a group. I would guide the classes through the process and at the end mix edit the media into a video that we shared online. This lead to the company needing a web site to promote their programs and showcase their media, thus I built them a custom Wordpress site from scratch. I found the work very challenging at first but once I figured out a few things I found deep satisfaction in writing code. Over the course of a year I tried learning as much as I could about how websites were put together. I played around with a few Wordpress templates but found myself needing to know more, which is when I found Refactor U. 

   I completed the program at Refactor U in March. For the final project I built an interactive music therapy application that played tones and flashed colored squares as the user clicked around on the interface. It also tracked what the user had chosen as their mood and notes entered during their session. It was by far the most unique application out of our cohort. Immediately following the bootcamp I built a Wordpress for a friend and helped another friend build a site using Bolt CMS. While both of the endeavors were good learning experiences I found myself wanting more exposure to how the pros play the game. So, I found an internship in Lakewood at BrieBug Solutions. For the most part I was writing Unit tests and completing various training materials. It was incredibly valuable to get hands on experience in an actual production level dev shop. I became proficient at writing the tests and my understanding of javascript improved immensely. I was made an offer to start as a contractor but turned it down because I want to stay closer to my home in Boulder. It was a tough decision to make but I'm hoping that it leads to work that keeps me interested and challenged in an environment where I can really thrive.

   I've always been a maker at heart, or at least someone who wants to learn and understand how to fix and make complex things. Whether it's writing and engineering a song, building a web app or doing maintenance on my car, I love to learn and make cool stuff happen. I think I would be a great fit at Rapt mainly because I love to play with media and web tech but also because I love to make new friends and meet interesting people. I think my sense of humor is unique and one of my best assets. Once you get to know me you'll never know how you got along without me. </p>
